#   Mahjong Calculator

A settlement calculator for a mahjong game called 'siap'.

During this CNY, I was introduced to a new kind of mahjong game called 'siap'. It's a fusion of rummy and traditional 4-player mahjong, offering a unique and enjoyable gaming experience. However, I realised that the calculation process for game settlement is quite cumbersome.

Driven by a desire to simplify this aspect of gameplay, I set out to develop a simple application that automates the settlement process. And now, it's here! Players can now bid farewell to the manual calculations üòÅ
