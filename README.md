#   Mahjong Game Calculator

A React web application designed to streamline the process of settling scores at the end of a Mahjong game. This application offers various features to facilitate the settlement process and ensure accuracy.

During this CNY, I was introduced to a new kind of mahjong game called 'siap'. It's a fusion of rummy and traditional 4-player mahjong, offering a unique and enjoyable gaming experience. However, I realised that the calculation process for game settlement is quite cumbersome.

Driven by a desire to simplify this aspect of gameplay, I set out to develop a simple application that automates the settlement process. And now, it's here! Players can now bid farewell to the manual calculations üòÅ

## Features
- **Player Name Editing**: Players can edit their respective names to be displayed during the settlement process.
- **Point Tracking**: Players can add the points earned for each round of the game. The application records the points of each round and displays the total cumulative points for each player.
- **Results Calculation**: With the click of a button, players can calculate the total points for each player and determine the settlement amount.
- **Detailed View**: Players can view the recorded points of each player for each round, as well as the calculation of the final points for each player.
- **Customisable Settings**: Players can manually set up their preferred base points and the cost for each point for the game.
